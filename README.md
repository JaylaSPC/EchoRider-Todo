# EchoRider-Todo
The name is completely random  
Everyone has to make a todo app at least once in their life.  
I made this in 3 hours.


What I learned:
- How to use customtkinter
- How to bind buttons to functions
- How to save data to a json file and how to load data from a json file

What I would change/add/improve:
- I would make it so that you can actually check off tasks from the list rather than just delete them
- I would change the color of the widgets and change the fonts
- I would make it so that when you select a task from the list it will display the full task at the bottom of the window because when the task is too long it gets cut off (I tried to do this and failed)
